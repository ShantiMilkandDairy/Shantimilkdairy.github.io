**Shanti Milk & Dairy** isn’t just a name.  
It’s a way of doing things — patiently, honestly, and with respect for what we consume.

We didn’t create this to chase trends or sell a label.  
We started because we wanted to bring back what once felt normal: **pure milk**, **handmade ghee**, and food that’s made with care — not chemicals.

Our grandmother didn’t run a dairy, but she lived by values that shape everything we do today.  
She believed in cooking with intention, sourcing with integrity, and sharing what’s good — not just what sells.

Shanti is a small tribute to that quiet wisdom.  
Not nostalgic. Just necessary.

## 🌿 Why “Shanti”?

Because we believe purity isn’t loud.  
It doesn’t need packaging tricks.  
It just needs care — and time.

We’re still small.  
We like it that way.  
Because this isn’t just business — it’s a way of doing right by what we eat, and how we live.

Thanks for being here.
