    Sourabh Bhardwaj — From Finance to Farming
  </figcaption>
</div>

### 🌱 A Journey Rooted in Purpose

Sourabh Bhardwaj is the founder and driving force behind **Shanti Milk & Dairy** — a venture born out of passion, purpose, and a deep desire to bring back purity in everyday nutrition.

An MBA graduate from **O.P. Jindal Global University** and a former banker at **HDFC**, Sourabh made a bold leap from corporate finance to conscious farming. Leaving behind the fast-paced urban life, he returned to his roots with one clear goal: to **restore trust in the food we consume**.

### 🐄 Honoring Traditions with Modern Ethics

Growing up in a household that celebrated traditional values and clean, homegrown food, he experienced firsthand the unmatched quality of milk and ghee made with care. Over time, as industrial processes and shortcuts replaced authenticity, Sourabh felt compelled to act.

Through Shanti Milk & Dairy, he is **redefining dairy practices** — blending modern hygiene with time-honored techniques. Whether it’s **A2 Sahiwal milk** from ethically nurtured cows or **Bilona ghee** hand-churned in small batches, every product reflects a commitment to **health, honesty, and heritage**.

### 💚 A Mission Beyond Business

For Sourabh, this isn't just a business — it's a movement to **make food sacred again**.

> *"Shanti is more than a name — it's a way of life. One that respects the animal, the farmer, the earth, and you."*  
> — **Sourabh Bhardwaj**
