### Why A2 Sahiwal Milk?

Our milk comes from native Indian Sahiwal cows — known for producing A2 protein-rich milk, which is easier to digest and more natural than the mass-produced A1 varieties.

We don’t homogenize or process it heavily.  
We let it stay as it should be — full of nutrients, untouched by chemicals, and sourced with care.

Real milk shouldn’t need marketing. It should just be **clean, local, and honest**.
