### The Bilona Way

Our ghee is made using the traditional **Bilona method** — a slow, two-step process that starts with curd, not cream.

This process preserves the nutritional richness and gives the ghee its natural golden color, aroma, and granular texture.

### Why It’s Better

- Cultured from curd, not just milk cream
- Hand-churned (bilona) with wooden churners
- Slow-cooked over fire in small batches
- No shortcuts, no additives

It takes longer — but it’s worth it.  
This is how ghee was always meant to be.
